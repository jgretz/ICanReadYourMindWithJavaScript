# I Can Read Your Mind With JavaScript
## Abstract
"Think of a number ...", "Take a card, any card ...", "Write down your favorite color ..." - for years, crowds have been amazed as magicians have seemingly read an audience member's mind. Although entertaining, these tricks were based on probability and sleight of hand, not true magic. The need for this facade is now over as the time has come to teach a computer to literally read your mind.

This talk will draw back the curtain and dive into the magic of machine learning and pattern matching using Node. You will watch in wonder as data captured by a headband is mystically transformed into a computer understanding what you are thinking and feeling. While exploring the code that implements these concepts, you will gain insight into how you too can create a little magic to add a spark to your every day life.

So come one, come all to see the amazing mind reading machine ...
