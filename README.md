# I Can Read Your Mind With Javascript
## Abstract
"Think of a number ...", "Take a card, any card ...", "Write down your favorite color ..." - for years, crowds have been amazed as magicians have seemingly read an audience member's mind. Although entertaining, these tricks were based on probability and slight of hand not true magic. The need for this facade is now over as the time has come to teach a computer to literally read minds.

This talk will draw back the curtain and dive into the magic of machine learning and pattern matching using Node. By connecting an external headband to feed these algorithms, you will be amazed as the computer starts to understand what you are thinking and feeling. While exploring the code needed to implement these concepts and marveling as the data flows, you will gain an understanding of how they could apply to real life.

So come one, come all to see the amazing mind reading machine ...
