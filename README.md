# I Can Read Your Mind With JavaScript
## Abstract
"Think of a number ...", "Take a card, any card ...", "Write down your favorite color ..." - for years, crowds have been amazed as magicians have seemingly read an audience member's mind. Although entertaining, these tricks were based on probability and sleight of hand, not true magic. The need for this fa√ßade is now over as the time has come to teach a computer to read your mind.

This talk will draw back the curtain and dive into the magic of machine learning and pattern matching using Node. By connecting an external headband to feed these algorithms <sup>1</sup>, you will be amazed as the computer starts to understand what you are thinking and feeling. While exploring the code needed to implement these concepts and marveling as the data flows<sup>2<sup>, you will gain an understanding of how they could apply to real life.

So come one, come all, to see the amazing mind reading machine ...

*1*: Such as what technologies?
*2*: I feel like there could be better wording here.
